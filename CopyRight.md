# Copyright and Preface

We present this collection of songs with hearts full of gratitude and reverence to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Music has always played a central role in Christian worship — from the psalms of David to the hymns of the early Church, from the quiet songs of personal devotion to the powerful anthems sung in gathered praise.

This songbook is designed to serve as a tool for personal edification and corporate worship. Whether used in church services, small groups, family devotionals, or moments of private reflection, we pray that these songs will draw you closer to the heart of God. Each lyric is a declaration of faith, a reminder of grace, and a call to live in the light of His truth and love.

May every voice lifted in song echo the joy, hope, and life we have in Christ. And may this collection inspire you to worship not only with your lips, but with your life.

**To God be the glory.**
